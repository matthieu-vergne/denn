# DENN

Welcome in my project for Darwinian Evolution of Neural Networks, my DENN for shorts.
It is a mere personnal project for trial and error, to see what I can do and what I can learn from it.
I had the idea since a long time ago, but never took the initiative to start it.
I thank [davidrandallmiller's nice video](https://youtu.be/N3tRFayqVtk), which brought me to finally try it too.
Not the same thing, but the same general idea: make the neural network evolve through genetic rather than learning.
